📄 DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18036675

---

### 📘 Overview  
**Shareh** is an explainable recommendation system based on a knowledge graph for Arabic content.  
It provides recommendations with interpretable reasoning paths, enhancing transparency in AI-based decision systems.

---

### ✨ Features  
- Uses **knowledge graph embeddings** to model relationships between entities.  
- Supports **Arabic-language datasets**.  
- Provides **explainable recommendation outputs** (e.g., item reasoning chains).  
- Includes evaluation metrics such as **RMSE** and **MAE**.

---

### ⚙️ How to Run  
1. Open the file `Shareh_code.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.  
2. Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the results.  
3. The dataset (`dataset.rar`) can be extracted and used for training or testing.
